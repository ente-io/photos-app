* Hide your photos!

On popular demand, ente now supports photos that are hidden behind a lock. This is in addition to the existing functionality to archive your photos so that they do not show in your timeline (but are otherwise visible).

* Add a description to your photos

You can now add a caption / description to your photos and videos. These will show up on the photo view.

* And search photos descriptions too

This allows you to, for example, tag your photos and quickly search for them.
